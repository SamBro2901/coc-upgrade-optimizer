# Clash of Clans Upgrade Optimizer

This tool provides an efficient way to plan your Clash of Clans village upgrades, helping you find the most optimal path to a maxed-out base. It takes your village data and generates two detailed upgrade schedules: one prioritizing the **shortest possible time** and another for the **longest possible time**, giving you flexibility in your strategy.

## How to Use üöÄ

Using the website is a straightforward process:

1.  **Extract your JSON data**: Go to your in-game settings and tap on the **"More Settings"** button. On this page, scroll down until you find the **"Data Export"** section and click on the **"Copy"** button.
2.  **Paste the data**: Once you have the JSON copied to your clipboard, paste the data in the text box below. You can see if the data you pasted is valid by reading the feedback under the text box.
3.  **Generate the schedule**: Click on either the **"Generate SPT"** or **"Generate LPT"** button to generate the respective upgrade schedule.
4.  **Timeline Cards & Chart**: Both timeline cards and timeline chart are generated. The cards make the upgrades more readable since smaller upgrades can appear very small in the chart. You can freely click on each card to mark them as completed for your own tracking purposes.

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **Dual Schedule Generation**: The website creates two distinct schedules‚Äîone focused on the fastest completion and one for a longer, more spread-out timeline.
- **Interactive Timeline Cards**: Each upgrade is represented as a timeline card. You can click on a card to mark it as "done," which will visually grey it out.
- **Dynamic Gantt Chart**: The generated Gantt chart provides a clear, visual representation of your upgrade timeline. When you mark a task as "done" on a timeline card, the corresponding bar on the Gantt chart also gets greyed out, ensuring seamless interoperability.
- **Zoomable View**: The Gantt chart includes a **zoom slider** that allows you to easily zoom in or out, providing a more detailed or high-level view of your schedule.
